# StaticShooter-frontend

This is a galaga-like browser-based video game built as my JavaScript project. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have PostgreSQL and Rails installed. Remember to run your PostgreSQL server for the DB as well as run the rails server from the [StaticShooter-backend](https://github.com/earthctzn/static-shooter-backend). Once you have the server running from the backend come back here and open the index.html file on your browser.
